Key foundational components in the traditional cloud service responsibility model: <br/>
`(On-prem → IaaS → PaaS → SaaS)`

> [!NOTE]
> `These 9 layers are conceptual, not exhaustive.` They represent the major areas of control and management.
> In reality, `there can be additional sub-layers or specialized services (e.g., security, identity, monitoring, compliance) that span across these layers.`

> 1.  **Applications** → End-user software and business apps running on the platform.
> 2.  **Data** → Information stored, processed, and managed within the system.
> 3.  **Runtime** → Execution environment for applications (e.g., .NET, Java).
> 4.  **Middleware** → Software that connects apps and services (e.g., messaging, APIs).
> 5.  **Operating System (O/S)** → Core system software managing hardware and apps.
> 6.  **Virtualization** → Abstraction layer enabling multiple OS instances on hardware.
> 7.  **Servers** → Physical or virtual machines hosting workloads.
> 8.  **Storage** → Persistent data storage systems (disks, blobs, databases).
> 9.  **Networking** → Connectivity infrastructure for communication and data transfer.

> - **Message (Service Bus)** → Use when you need **guaranteed delivery**, **ordering**, or **transactional integrity**.
> - **Stream (Event Hubs)** → Ideal for **high-throughput streaming** scenarios like **IoT telemetry** or **real-time analytics**.

<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9005aac-1014-41d2-85bc-ae7327b87bf2" />

| **Aspect**          | **Event**                                                                                                              | **Message** | **Stream** |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**      | Lightweight notification that something happened; does **not** carry full business data.                               | Data packet intended for processing; often contains business-critical info with guaranteed delivery. | Continuous flow of data for real-time processing and analytics.                                                 |
| **Characteristics** | - Fire-and-forget (basic retries only)<br>- Reactive architectures<br>- Small payload (metadata)                       | - Durable storage until processed<br>- Supports sessions, transactions, DLQs<br>- Larger payloads | - High-throughput ingestion<br>- Partitioned for scalability<br>- Designed for streaming scenarios              |
| **Azure Service**   | **Event Grid**: Routes events from sources (Blob Storage, IoT Hub) to subscribers (Functions, Logic Apps).             | **Service Bus**: Enterprise messaging with FIFO, sessions, and reliability. | **Event Hubs**: Ingest millions of events per second for telemetry and analytics.                               |

<summary><b>Diagram explanation</b> (Click to expand)</summary>

> *   **Step 1: Capture file in Storage**: Data or files are first captured and stored in **Azure Storage**. This provides durable storage for raw input data.
> *   **Step 2: Capture event in Event Grid**: When an event occurs in **Event Hubs** (such as streaming data ingestion), **Event Grid** captures the event and triggers downstream processing.
> *   **Step 3: Capture event data in Azure Function App**
>     *   The event data is sent to an **Azure Function App**, which acts as a serverless compute component to process the event.
>     *   The function retrieves the file from **Azure Storage** (Step 4) for further processing.
> *   **Step 5: Data migration to Synapse Analytics**: After processing, the data is migrated to **Azure Synapse Analytics** for advanced analytics, reporting, and business intelligence.
