<details>
<summary>Migration Path Explained</summary>

> When migrating workloads, the first question is whether the application is **already optimized for the cloud**:

*   **If optimized:**
    *   Use **Azure App Service** for web applications.
    *   Use **Azure VMware Solution** for VMware-based workloads.

*   **If not optimized:**
    *   Check if the workload can be **containerized**:
        *   **Yes:** Choose orchestration solutions like:
            *   **VMware Tanzu on Azure VMs**
            *   **Kubernetes on Azure VMs**
            *   **OpenShift on Azure VMs**
        *   **No:** Use **Virtual Machines** for a lift-and-shift approach.

*   For VMware-specific workloads, **Azure VMware Solution** provides a seamless migration path.

</details>

<details>
<summary> Building New Applications Explained </summary>

> For new builds, start by asking if you need **full control**:

*   **Yes:**
    *   Use **Virtual Machines** for complete control.
    *   Use **Azure Batch** for HPC workloads.

*   **No:**
    *   Is the workload **event-driven** with short-lived processes?
        *   **Yes:** Use **Azure Functions** for serverless execution.
    *   Do you need **managed web hosting**?
        *   **Yes:** Use **Azure App Service**.
    *   Do you need **full orchestration**?
        *   **Yes:** Options include:
            *   **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**
            *   **Azure Container Apps**
            *   **Azure Service Fabric**
            *   **Red Hat OpenShift**
        *   **No:** Use **Azure Container Instances** or **Azure Container Apps** for lightweight container hosting.

From [Choose an Azure compute option for microservices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/microservices/design/compute-options)

> - This diagram is a **decision-making guide for selecting the right Azure compute service** based on application requirements. It starts with the question of whether your workload needs **dedicated compute resources** or can run in a **serverless environment**.
> - If **dedicated compute is required**, the next consideration is whether **GPU access** is needed. GPU requirements often indicate workloads like AI/ML or high-performance computing.
> - From there, the diagram asks if **Kubernetes API access** is necessary. If yes, the best choice is **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**, which provides full Kubernetes orchestration and control. If Kubernetes API access is not needed, then **Azure Container Apps** is recommended for running containerized microservices without managing Kubernetes directly.
> - If **dedicated compute is not required**, the diagram moves toward **serverless options**. It checks if the workload is a **containerized microservice**. If yes, **Azure Container Apps** is suitable because it supports serverless containers with autoscaling. If not containerized, the next question is whether the workload is **code-based and non-containerized**. If yes, **Azure Functions** is the ideal choice for event-driven, serverless execution of small pieces of code.

## Choose a hybrid option

> These options enable hybrid and edge computing scenarios, allowing organizations to run Azure services in disconnected, on-premises, or multicloud environments.

<details>
<summary><b>Diagram explanation</b> (Click to expand)</summary>

> *   This diagram is a **decision-making guide for selecting the right Azure edge or hybrid compute service** based on hosting, deployment, and workload requirements. It starts by asking whether the solution is **existing/custom**, **multicloud**, or **Azure-specified**.
> *   If the solution is **existing or custom**, the next consideration is whether it is **restricted** or **datacenter-based**.
>     *   For **restricted environments**, the diagram distinguishes between **mass deployment** (ideal for IoT workloads) and **low-scale deployment** (traditional IT and cloud-native workloads).
>         *   **Mass deployment** leads to **Azure IoT Edge**, which enables running cloud intelligence locally on IoT devices.
>     *   For **datacenter-based workloads**, the decision focuses on whether the workload uses **containers**, **VMs**, or **SQL**.
>         *   **Containers** → Use **Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes** for hybrid container orchestration.
>         *   **VMware workloads** → Use **Azure Arc-enabled VMware, SCVMM, or individual servers** for management.
>         *   **SQL workloads** → Use **Azure Arc-enabled data services** for hybrid database capabilities.
> *   If the solution is **multicloud**, similar options apply for containers, VMs, and SQL, leveraging **Azure Arc** for unified management across clouds.
> *   If the solution is **Azure-specified**, the decision moves to **hardware type** and **workload type**:
>     *   **Hardware as a service** or **Azure-like datacenter** leads to **Azure Local** or **Azure Stack Hub** for full Azure capabilities on-premises.
>     *   For **data transfer and compute**, the diagram offers **Azure Stack Edge** devices in different models:
>         *   **Datacenter** → Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU
>         *   **Portable** → Azure Stack Edge Pro 2
>         *   **Ruggedized** → Azure Stack Edge Mini R or Pro R

From [Choose a load balancing solution for your scenario](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/load-balancing-overview#choose-a-load-balancing-solution-for-your-scenario)

<details>
<summary><b>Diagram explanation</b> (Click to expand)</summary>

> *   It starts by asking if the workload is a **web application (HTTP/HTTPS)**.
>     *   If **No**, and the application is not internet-facing, the recommendation is **Azure Load Balancer** for internal traffic distribution.
>     *   If **Yes**, and the application is internet-facing, the next question is whether it is **global or deployed in multiple regions**.
>         *   If **Yes**, the solution combines **Traffic Manager + Azure Load Balancer** for global DNS-based routing and regional load balancing.
> *   For **API-only hosting**, the diagram suggests **API Management** for secure API publishing and lifecycle management.
> *   If the application is internet-facing and not limited to APIs, the next consideration is whether you need **SSL offload or application-layer processing per request**.
>     *   If **Yes**, use **Azure Front Door + Application Gateway** for global load balancing with advanced Layer 7 features.
>     *   If hosting only APIs with SSL offload, use **Azure Front Door + API Management**.
> *   For hosting scenarios like **PaaS (App Service, Functions)**, **IaaS (VMs)**, or **AKS**, the diagram recommends:
>     *   **Azure Front Door** for global routing and acceleration.
>     *   Combine with **Application Gateway ingress controller** for AKS or **Azure Load Balancer** for VMs.
> *   If **performance acceleration** is required, **Azure Front Door** is the primary choice because it provides global edge caching and routing.
> *   For workloads that do not require global distribution but need Layer 7 routing, **Application Gateway** is recommended.
>     *   For API-only workloads in this scenario, combine **Application Gateway + API Management**.
